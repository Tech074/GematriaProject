Values:
The most evident system
A=1 B=2 C=3 ... Z=26

Set to reverse values:
A=26 B=25 C=24 ... Z=1

Set to a multiple:
A=1 * 6
B=2 * 6
WORD = 60 * 6

Skipping by letters:
W = 23
Set the interval to 23 and move forward 23 letters to the next letter to use as a new interval.


Skipping by words:
WORD = 60
Set the interval to 60 and skip forward 60 letters to select a new letter.
Then select the word the selected letter is located in and use the sum as a new interval forward.


Alternating:
Determine method for alternating forwards and backwards intervals.
For instance: 
  1. if a vowel: move backward or if consonant: move forward.
  2. if number value is odd or even


Determine initial direction of alternating:
radio button: start backward or forward
